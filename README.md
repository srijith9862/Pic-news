## Problem Statement 

1. The attention span of an average user is too less to read a complete news article of standard length. This leads to less frequent usage of news apps, as majority of news applications are text heavy. For more efficient usage of news application, we want to deviate from text-heavy news articles to visual and text-reduced news articles.  
2. We also aim at providing users, news articles based on their interest using ML Algorithms.   
3. Snapshot of news, user is interested in under a minute.
